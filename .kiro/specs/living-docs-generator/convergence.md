## Reality Checks

### After Each Task Completion
1. **Does it actually work?** Run the feature end-to-end with real files
2. **Is it fast enough?** Measure update time from file save to UI refresh
3. **Does it handle errors?** Test with malformed/empty/binary files
4. **Is it integrated?** Verify it works within Kiro's MCP ecosystem
5. **Can you demo it?** Show a stakeholder the working functionality

### Weekly Progress Validation
1. **User Story Validation**: Can a developer actually use this to solve documentation problems?
2. **Performance Reality**: Measure actual memory usage and update times
3. **Integration Reality**: Test all Kiro integration points work as designed
4. **Code Quality**: Review for mocks, TODOs, and technical debt
