# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Living Documentation Generator is an intelligent MCP server for Kiro that automatically generates, maintains, and updates project documentation in real-time. Unlike traditional documentation tools that create static snapshots, this system continuously analyzes code changes, git history, and project structure to keep documentation current and contextually relevant. The tool focuses on zero-configuration deployment, beautiful presentation, and deep Kiro integration to showcase advanced IDE capabilities while solving the universal developer problem of outdated documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Documentation Generation

**User Story:** As a Kiro user, I want the documentation generator to leverage Kiro's unique capabilities like steering files, hooks, and contextual awareness, so that it integrates seamlessly into my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN steering files define documentation standards THEN the system SHALL apply team-specific formatting, terminology, and structure rules
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN Kiro hooks SHALL trigger appropriate documentation updates automatically
3. WHEN reviewing pull requests THEN the system SHALL show documentation changes alongside code changes
4. WHEN working on specific features THEN the system SHALL provide contextual documentation relevant to current work
5. WHEN multiple team members work on the same project THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent documentation style across contributors
6. IF documentation templates are defined in steering THEN the system SHALL use custom templates for different document types

### Requirement 6: Multi-Language and Multi-Format Support

**User Story:** As a developer working with diverse technology stacks, I want the documentation generator to handle multiple programming languages and output formats, so that it works across all my projects regardless of technology choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing JavaScript/TypeScript projects THEN the system SHALL extract JSDoc comments, function signatures, and module exports
2. WHEN processing Python code THEN the system SHALL parse docstrings, type hints, and class hierarchies
3. WHEN handling Go projects THEN the system SHALL document packages, interfaces, and struct definitions
4. WHEN working with REST APIs THEN the system SHALL generate OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
5. WHEN detecting database migrations THEN the system SHALL document schema changes and relationships
6. IF unsupported file types are encountered THEN the system SHALL gracefully skip them and log the limitation

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a developer working on large codebases, I want the documentation generator to perform efficiently without slowing down my development workflow, so that real-time updates don't impact productivity.
