This script provides a structured presentation flow to showcase the key differentiators and capabilities of the Living Documentation Generator.

## 🎯 Demo Objectives

- Demonstrate zero-configuration setup and intelligent project detection
- Show real-time documentation updates in action
- Highlight multi-language support and beautiful output
- Showcase advanced features like search, API docs, and architecture diagrams
- Prove performance and scalability with real metrics

## 📋 Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] Demo environment is set up and tested
- [ ] All services are running (frontend, backend, Python, Go)
- [ ] Documentation server is started on port 3000
- [ ] Browser windows are prepared and positioned
- [ ] Code editor is ready with demo files open

## 🎬 Demo Flow (15-20 minutes)

### **Act 1: The Problem (2 minutes)**

**Narrative:** "Documentation is the bane of every developer's existence. It's always outdated, incomplete, or missing entirely."

**Key Points:**
- Traditional documentation tools create static snapshots
- Developers hate writing documentation because it becomes stale immediately
- Teams struggle with inconsistent documentation across projects
- Onboarding new developers is painful without current docs

**Visual:** Show examples of outdated documentation, broken links, missing API docs

---

### **Act 2: The Solution - Zero Configuration Magic (3 minutes)**

**Narrative:** "What if documentation could be living, breathing, and always current? What if it required zero setup?"

#### **2.1 Intelligent Project Detection**
```bash
# In Kiro, run the MCP tool
detect_project with projectPath: "/path/to/demo"
```

**Show:**
- Automatic language detection (TypeScript, Python, Go)
- Framework recognition (React, Express, Flask)
- Smart configuration generation
- Zero manual setup required

**Key Differentiator:** "Most tools require complex configuration. We work out of the box."

#### **2.2 First Documentation Generation**
```bash
generate_docs with projectPath: "/path/to/demo"
```

**Show:**
- Multi-language analysis in seconds
- Beautiful web interface generation
- Comprehensive function/class extraction
- API endpoint detection

**Metrics to Highlight:**
- "Analyzed 50+ files across 3 languages in under 5 seconds"
- "Found 25 functions, 8 classes, 12 API endpoints automatically"

---

### **Act 3: Real-Time Magic (4 minutes)**

**Narrative:** "The real magic happens when you start coding. Watch this..."

#### **3.1 Enable Real-Time Watching**
```bash
watch_project with projectPath: "/path/to/demo"
```

#### **3.2 Live Code Changes**
**Open:** `frontend/src/components/UserProfile.tsx`

**Change 1:** Add a new prop to the interface
```typescript
/** Whether to show user statistics */
showStats?: boolean;
```

**Show:** Documentation updates within 3 seconds in the web interface

**Change 2:** Add a new function
```typescript
/**
 * Calculate user engagement score
 * @param sessions Number of user sessions
 * @param pageviews Total page views
 * @returns Engagement score between 0 and 1
 */
export function calculateEngagement(sessions: number, pageviews: number): number {
  return Math.min((sessions * pageviews) / 1000, 1);
}
```

**Show:** New function appears in documentation immediately

**Key Differentiator:** "This isn't just file watching - it's intelligent semantic analysis in real-time."

#### **3.3 Cross-Language Updates**
**Switch to:** `python-service/models/user_analytics.py`

**Add:** New method to existing class
```python
def calculate_retention_rate(self, days: int = 30) -> float:
    """
    Calculate user retention rate over specified period
    
    Args:
        days (int): Number of days to analyze
        
    Returns:
        float: Retention rate as percentage
    """
    return 85.5  # Placeholder implementation
```

**Show:** Python documentation updates alongside TypeScript

## 🎤 Speaking Points and Transitions

### **Opening Hook**
"Raise your hand if you've ever opened documentation that was completely wrong or outdated... Keep it up if you've ever been that developer who didn't update the docs... We've all been there."

### **Problem Agitation**
"The fundamental problem with documentation is that it's a snapshot in time. The moment you write it, your code starts evolving, and your docs start dying."

### **Solution Introduction**
"What if documentation could be alive? What if it could evolve with your code, understand your intent, and stay current automatically?"

### **Demo Transitions**
- "Let me show you what this looks like in practice..."
- "Now here's where it gets interesting..."
- "But wait, there's more..." (use sparingly!)
- "This is just the beginning..."

### **Closing Strong**
"This isn't just a documentation tool - it's a paradigm shift. It's documentation that lives, breathes, and grows with your code. It's the end of outdated docs."

## 🔧 Technical Setup Notes
