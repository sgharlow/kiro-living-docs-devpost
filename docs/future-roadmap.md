ðŸš€ ROADMAP & MATERIAL IMPROVEMENTS TO CONSIDER
Based on my analysis, here are the most impactful improvements that would elevate this project further:

1. Visual Architecture Diagrams (High Impact, Medium Effort)
// Add to DocumentationGenerator
generateArchitectureDiagrams(analysis: ProjectAnalysis): DiagramAssets
Why: Visual learners need diagrams, especially for complex multi-service architectures
Impact: Makes the demo much more compelling and professional
Effort: 4-6 hours to implement Mermaid diagram generation from dependency analysis
2. Live Demo Mode with Synthetic Changes (High Impact, Low Effort)
// Add to MCP server
simulate_code_changes: 'Demonstrate real-time updates with synthetic file changes'
Why: Demo reliability - no dependency on live coding during presentations
Impact: Ensures smooth, predictable demos every time
Effort: 2-3 hours to create pre-scripted change scenarios
3. Export to Popular Platforms (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)
export_documentation: 'Export to GitBook, Confluence, Notion formats'
Why: Integration with existing documentation workflows
Impact: Shows enterprise readiness and practical adoption path
Effort: 3-4 hours per platform integration
4. AI-Powered Documentation Suggestions (High Impact, High Effort)
suggest_improvements: 'AI-powered suggestions for missing documentation'
Why: Proactive documentation quality improvement
Impact: Differentiates from all other documentation tools
Effort: 8-12 hours (would need AI integration)
